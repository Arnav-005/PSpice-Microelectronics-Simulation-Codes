# PSpice Circuit Simulations

## Overview
This repository contains circuit designs and simulation models developed during the **Microelectronic Circuits** coursework at NSUT (ECE Department).

The simulations were performed using **OrCAD PSpice** to verify theoretical circuit responses against practical models.

## Project Structure
* **Analog Circuits:**
    * BJT/MOSFET Amplifiers (CE, CC, CS configurations)
    * Operational Amplifier Applications (Inverting, Non-Inverting, Integrator)
    * Active Filters (Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass)
* **Digital/Power:**
    * Rectifiers (Half-wave, Full-wave)
    * Clippers and Clampers
    * Voltage Regulators

## Simulation Types
* **Transient Analysis:** Time-domain response verification.
* **AC Sweep:** Frequency response and Bode plot analysis.
* **DC Sweep:** Transfer characteristics (VTC) of transistors.

## Software Used
* **Cadence OrCAD PSpice**
* **MATLAB** (for theoretical verification)
